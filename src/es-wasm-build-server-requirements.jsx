    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Automated testing is the process of using software tools to run tests on code automatically, ensuring that the application behaves as expected without manual intervention. It helps catch bugs early, improves code quality, and speeds up the development cycle.

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How is Automated Testing Done in Codebases?</h3>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      In codebases, automated tests are written using testing frameworks and libraries such as Jest, Mocha, or Cypress. These tests can be unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests. Developers write test cases that define expected inputs and outputs, then run these tests automatically during development or continuous integration to verify code correctness.

    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <li>Choose appropriate testing tools and frameworks for your technology stack.</li>
      <li>Write test cases covering different parts of your application.</li>
      <li>Integrate tests into your development workflow and CI/CD pipelines.</li>
      <li>Run tests frequently to catch regressions and ensure stability.</li>
