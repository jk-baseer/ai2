        Simplicity in design means removing unnecessary elements and focusing on
        what truly matters. It helps users navigate and understand content
        effortlessly.

      <p>
        By prioritizing clean layouts, minimal color palettes, and intuitive
        interactions, designers create experiences that feel natural and
        engaging.

      <p>
        Remember, simplicity is not about less, but about making every element
        count.
