  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What is WebAssembly (Wasm)?</h1>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
    <strong>WebAssembly (Wasm)</strong> is a binary instruction format designed as a portable compilation target for high-level programming languages like C, C++, and Rust. It enables code to run at near-native speed in web browsers, providing a way to execute complex applications and computations efficiently on the web.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">How Has Wasm Evolved in Modern Browsers?</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6">
    <li class="mb-2"><strong>2015-2017:</strong> Wasm was developed as a collaborative effort by major browser vendors (Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, Apple) to replace asm.js and provide a faster, safer, and more efficient way to run code on the web.</li>
    <li class="mb-2"><strong>2017:</strong> All major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) shipped initial support for Wasm, making it a web standard.</li>
    <li class="mb-2"><strong>2018-2020:</strong> Wasm gained support for threads, SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data), and debugging tools, enabling more advanced applications like games, video editors, and scientific simulations.</li>
    <li class="mb-2"><strong>2021 and beyond:</strong> Wasm is now used beyond browsers, powering serverless platforms, blockchain runtimes, and edge computing. Features like garbage collection, module linking, and improved security are being added.</li>
  </ul>
